# Sample contribution content based on the topic "Finding SQL Injections"

## What is the structure of this repository?

* `docker`: contains a docker image that builds a hands-on training exercise, in this case written in Node.js, useful for learning how to find SQL injections via a login form.
* `en`: contains a single file called `README.md` which is actually the technical content that explains how to manually find SQL injections in web applications. At the end of this file there is a special mark to indicate where the docker image (the practical exercise) will be attached when the file is processed on our platform.
* `properties.json`: contains some informational data.
